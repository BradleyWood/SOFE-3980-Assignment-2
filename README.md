### Intro

As part of SOFE 3980 assignment #2, I have created a simple sliding puzzle game
and provided various tests using my own testing framework.

### Setup instruction

Install Apache Maven build tool

```
git clone https://github.com/BradleyWood/SOFE-3980-Assignment-2.git
```

The project can be built with the following command
```
mvn install
```


### SQTF Testing Framework

As a bonus for this assignment I created a light weight testing framework
that can be integrated with maven projects. Each test is implemented using
this framework.
